# Filters

There are 2 fundamental types of filters. Low pass and high pass. You often hear of notch filters and band pass filters but they are really just sort of low pass and high pass filters superimposed on each other in a sort of cascade.

When I was taking basic circuits, the class quickly went into filters after capacitors with essentially no context as to what a filter is. We studied filters from a purely time domain point of view because the math we had for RC circuits was time domain math. And our initial forays into filters with time constants was with DC step functions.

Without this context, I knew there was a thing called a filter and that it did something, but I had no idea that what it did was so simple. The problem is that it is only simple if you approach filters from a frequency domain point of view. Studying filters from a time domain point of view is useful only to 2 groups:
1) people who haven't been exposed to frequency domain and only have the math for time domain analysis
2) people who understand filters extemely well and need to look at time domain to deepen their understanding.
One of these types is legitimate. I was the other type.
