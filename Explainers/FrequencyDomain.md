# Frequency Domain

When you were in high school algebra and learned the terms 'range' and 'domain', you (and certainly other people as well) probably asked, when will I ever need to know this? Well, if that time hadn't come yet, it just did.

There are atleast two really important 'domains' in RF. These are time domain and frequency domain. They are actaully both really simple.

Time Domain is what we experience naturally. Things happen with time. If we graph something over time, it's in the time domain. We see it all the time in economics. Interest rates over time, for example. Or crime rate over time. Examples abound.

Frequency domain is a way to visualize cyclic data.

Frequency domain contains less information than a time domain representation because it's more of a representation over time.

If something is cyclic you can watch the up and down of the cycles. Or you can represent the cycles as a frequency.

OK, I think this is starting to get hard even though it's easy.

Imagine a pure sine wave. When you hear a pure sine wave, it sounds very pure. If you have never heard a pure sine wave, I recommend you load an app into your phone that produces sine waves line Frequency Generator. It is useful to know what pure sine waves sound like.

Once you have a good idea of what a pure sine wave sounds like, it's time to start understanding frequency domain.

Another phone app you can load in is something like Spectroid. This will go a really long way to understanding frequency domain.
