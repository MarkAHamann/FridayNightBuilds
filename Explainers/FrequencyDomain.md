# Frequency Domain

When you were in high school algebra and learned the terms 'range' and 'domain', you (and certainly other people as well) probably asked, when will I ever need to know this? Well, if that time hadn't come yet, it just did.

There are atleast two really important 'domains' in RF. These are time domain and frequency domain. They are actaully both really simple.

Time Domain is what we experience naturally. Things happen with time. If we graph something over time, it's in the time domain. We see it all the time in economics. Interest rates over time, for example. Or crime rate over time. Examples abound.

Frequency domain is a way to visualize cyclic data.

Frequency domain contains less information than a time domain representation because it's more of a representation over time.

If something is cyclic you can watch the up and down of the cycles. Or you can represent the cycles as a frequency.

OK, I think this is starting to get hard even though it's easy.

# Phone Apps

##  Frequency Generator
Imagine a pure sine wave. When you hear a pure sine wave, it sounds very pure. If you have never heard a pure sine wave, I recommend you load an app into your phone that produces sine waves line Frequency Generator. It is useful to know what pure sine waves sound like.

Once you have a good idea of what a pure sine wave sounds like, it's time to start understanding frequency domain.

Another phone app you can load in is something like Spectroid. This will go a really long way to understanding frequency domain.

## Spectroid

Frequency domain starts to really become clear if you play with a program like Spectroid on your smart phone. Spectroid is essentially a spectrum analyzer for audio frequencies. It has 2 parts.

The first part is the spectrum analyzer. It shows a line that goes across the screen horizontally and that line is higher in freqencies that have more energy. If you start it up and sing a siren, you'll see a peak that goes right as your tone goes higher and to the left as your tone goes lower.

Under that is a part of a program called a waterfall. The waterfall takes the intensity of each frequecy and assigns colors. The entire line gradually scrolls down. If you whistle higher and lower and higher and lower over and over, you'll see the line in the waterfall going back and forth and back and forth.

Have fun with it. Sing and whistle and bang stuff together. If you have a tuning fork or a guitar tuner or a musical instrument, you can see the frequency as you play it and see the history in the waterfall.

This will give you a good intuitive understanding of frequency domain. If you talk, you'll see that your voice is filled with frequencies. If you hit a tuning fork, you'll likely see a pretty sharp spike at the frequency of the tuning fork. If you sing, you'll see a lot of frequency, but you'll see the particular note being dominant.
